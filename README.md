# The daily challenge has come to change the way you learn a language.


### How does this methodology work?

This methodology is based on the principle found in the book "The Power of Habit" and I will give a brief explanation of how creating a repetition structure can be powerful for both learning to program efficiently and also for performing any other task in your day-to-day.

Habits are automated behaviors that occur as a result of a routine or pattern of thought. They are formed through repetition and can be modified through new routines and patterns of thought.

When we perform an action repeatedly, the brain creates a neural pathway for that action. Over time, this action becomes automated and occurs more quickly and easily. For example, when we learn to drive, we need to think about each step in the process, but after a while, driving becomes a habit and we no longer need to think about each step.

Habits are formed through a sequence of three steps: the trigger, the routine, and the reward. The trigger is the stimulus that triggers the habit, such as seeing a can of soda. The routine is the action that is performed in response to the trigger, such as grabbing the can of soda and opening it. The reward is the positive result that we receive from the routine, such as the feeling of satisfaction or the pleasure of drinking the soda.

### Accept reality:

The first thing you must do to create consistency in programming and learning a language is to first accept that programming is an area that requires discipline and dedication, without consistency and making it your life, you will probably have difficulties in progressing, and you will walk at a turtle's pace, I myself study for a year and only now realized that I barely know how to manipulate the DOM, when I should be learning a framework and doing backend tests.

Virtual detox:
How much time do you dedicate to social networks? How much time do you lose watching videos on TikTok, watching photos and the lives of other people on Instagram, have you ever had the feeling of losing your day doing these things and when you realize you literally didn't do anything and procrastinated? And now is the time for you to unplug your phone and focus only on the terminal of your computer, seriously, do it now, turn off your phone or put it in airplane mode and hide it in your closet, you will thank me later.

### procedures for housing and organization:

The first step is to organize the exercises in an orderly manner and with different difficulties, start with the basic concepts of the language, functions and objects, loops and conditionals, data types and logical operators, and finally create basic exercises to fix in your mind the syntax and make your muscle memory create agile and dynamic typing."

### Dive into the water:

To avoid the imposter syndrome, take a chance and try something new in your day, even if you believe you are not capable, try using a new library, a feature, or a challenge that recruiters use in interviews, create a CRUD, learn a new syntax in a language that you are not familiar with, put your fear aside and create that application that you have been procrastinating for months that has a tutorial on YouTube where an Indian with a strong accent in English teaches you step by step better than expensive courses you pay for, try, because only then, after diving into the water, you will realize that swimming wasn't a seven-headed monster, but something you just had to do, so do it, be passionate and obsessed, because obsession wins over talent 100% of the time, extract the maximum from this brain damaged by dopamine and vices in social networks, use it in a way that you can enrich yourself, both financially and spiritually, programming is the sea you need to dive into and don't be afraid of the sharks, because you're ready to bite your first opportunity.

#### Eu coloquei o texto em ingles acima para lembrar a voce que ingles e importantissimo para um dev, tanto para entender alguns conceitos melhor em ingles, ler docs, e para tambem voce ter mais um leque de oportunidade para trabalhar remoto em vagas gringas.

#### Mas vai aqui a traducao do texto:

... achou mesmo que eu ia traduzir ? voce nao entendeu o proposito ne ? saia da zona de conforto.
