# The daily challenge has come to change the way you learn a language.


### How does this methodology work?

This methodology is based on the principle found in the book "The Power of Habit" and I will give a brief explanation of how creating a repetition structure can be powerful for both learning to program efficiently and also for performing any other task in your day-to-day.

Habits are automated behaviors that occur as a result of a routine or pattern of thought. They are formed through repetition and can be modified through new routines and patterns of thought.

When we perform an action repeatedly, the brain creates a neural pathway for that action. Over time, this action becomes automated and occurs more quickly and easily. For example, when we learn to drive, we need to think about each step in the process, but after a while, driving becomes a habit and we no longer need to think about each step.

Habits are formed through a sequence of three steps: the trigger, the routine, and the reward. The trigger is the stimulus that triggers the habit, such as seeing a can of soda. The routine is the action that is performed in response to the trigger, such as grabbing the can of soda and opening it. The reward is the positive result that we receive from the routine, such as the feeling of satisfaction or the pleasure of drinking the soda.

Accept reality:
The first thing you must do to create consistency in programming and learning a language is to first accept that programming is an area that requires discipline and dedication, without consistency and making it your life, you will probably have difficulties in progressing, and you will walk at a turtle's pace, I myself study for a year and only now realized that I barely know how to manipulate the DOM, when I should be learning a framework and doing backend tests.

Virtual detox:
How much time do you dedicate to social networks? How much time do you lose watching videos on TikTok, watching photos and the lives of other people on Instagram, have you ever had the feeling of losing your day doing these things and when you realize you literally didn't do anything and procrastinated? And now is the time for you to unplug your phone and focus only on the terminal of your computer, seriously, do it now, turn off your phone or put it in airplane mode and hide it in your closet, you will thank me later.

Architecture and organization:
The first step is to organize the exercises in an orderly manner and with different difficulties, start with the basic concepts of the language, functions and objects, loops and conditionals, data types and logical operators, and finally create basic exercises to fix in your mind the syntax and make your muscle memory create agile and dynamic typing."
